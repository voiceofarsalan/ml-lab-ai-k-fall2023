# Machine Learning Lab â€“ Fall 2023 (AI K)

This repository contains my lab work for the Machine Learning course at FAST-NUCES (Fall 2023), under section AI K.

## ðŸ“˜ Notebook Details

- Filename: `21i_0271_ArsalanAhmed.ipynb`
- Covers fundamental ML algorithms and assignments including:
  - Linear Regression
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Means Clustering
  - Naive Bayes
  - Decision Trees
  - SVM
  - Model evaluation (accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix)

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
